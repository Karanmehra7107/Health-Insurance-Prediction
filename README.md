<p>About project<p/>
<p>A simple yet challenging project, to anticipate whether the insurance will be claimed or not. The complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, & is slightly imbalanced. Can you overcome these obstacles & build a good predictive model to classify them?
